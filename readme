Interpreter HW2 Resubmission

Compile:
   
   g++ -std=c++11 mypython.cpp lex.yy.c -o mypython

Run:

  mypython <file.py

Limitations:
- Must have an extra line at the end otherwise it will not
read the last statement.
- When evaluating for if statements, it needs to have spaces
between variable - operator - variable. (ex. if x <= y:) and
cannot be (if x<=y:)
